# Classroom-Video-Platform

This is a classroom video platform designed to have an environment suitable for instructor-to-student interactions. This project is based upon a Zoom clone tutorial as shown in the credits. The project will be updated to reflect a platform more suitable for K-12 educators (e.g. whiteboard function).
